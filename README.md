# Bamazon-App
Node CLI App that uses MySQL to simulate Amazon-like marketplace

# WELCOME TO BAMAZON!

Bamazon is an app that utilizes Javascript, Node.js and MySQL runs exclusively in the command line. Because of this please find below screenshots to better exemplify the app's functionality.

Once in the command line, the user inputs node bamazonCustomer.js

### This is the table of products in the store and the user is prompted with two questions about a purchase:

### IF there IS ENOUGH of the item in stock, the user receives the following message:

### IF there IS NOT ENOUGH of the item in stock, the user instead receives this message:

_**Special Note: I had some difficulty with this assignment, so in the messages, you see the response from the database. I had some trouble figuring out how to access the response object, so I repeatedly console-logged it. As I continue to work and improve the application I will remove this console log. For now, it remains so I know what the response is in order to be able to manipulate the data.**_
